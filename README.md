# Simple Description

You will be writing a simple Java program that implements some basic file I/O operations. You can use this code as the basis for some of your next project.

Using the skeleton below, write the method displayFile that takes a String as input. This method should try to opens that file if it exists and reads the file one line at a time printing each line to the screen. You must implement the file read in a try/catch block rather than throwing the exception on any of the method headers. The name of the text file you will be using is jabberwock.txt.

You must also write a main method that prompts the user for a filename to print to the screen and then calls your displayFile method with that filename.

Use the code skeleton below to start your code. Then look at the course notes on File I/O to fill in what you need in the skeleton. Your prompt to the screen should look like the following to match the test cases:

Enter a filename: jabberwock.txt
If the file does not exist, your program should produce an error message with the name of the file in it. For example, if the user types in the name alice.txt then the error message to the screen should read:

ERROR - File alice.txt not found!
The example file contains the following text that should be printed to the console:

Jabberwocky

'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.

"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
The frumious Bandersnatch!"

He took his vorpal sword in hand:
Long time the manxome foe he sought
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
And stood awhile in thought.

And as in uffish thought he stood,
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
And burbled as it came!

One, two! One, two! and through and through
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
He went galumphing back.

"And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!"
He chortled in his joy.

'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.
